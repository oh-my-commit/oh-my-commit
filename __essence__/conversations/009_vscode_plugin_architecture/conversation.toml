assistant_response = """Based on the analysis of your current VSCode plugin architecture, here are the recommended approaches for making it reusable:

1. Create a Yeoman Generator (Scaffolding Tool):
- Most flexible option for VSCode extension templates
- Can generate the entire project structure with all configurations
- Allows users to customize during generation
- Can include all the modern stack (TS + React + Tailwind + Jotai)
- Supports monorepo setup with Turborepo

2. NPM Package Strategy:
- Create core utilities as separate npm packages:
  - @your-scope/vscode-webview-react-core
  - @your-scope/vscode-extension-utils
  - @your-scope/vscode-state-management
- Benefits of modular approach
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Users can pick what they need

3. GitHub Template Repository:
- Serve as a boilerplate
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Pre-configured development environment
- CI/CD templates
- Example implementations

Recommended Approach: Combination of 1 & 2
1. Create modular npm packages for core functionalities
2. Build a Yeoman generator that:
- Sets up the project structure
- Installs the npm packages
- Configures all tooling
- Generates example code

This gives users both flexibility and structure while maintaining the modern development stack you've established."""
